My dog sasha is my best friend.She likes to chose the saccer ball when i practice.It is so funny to see her running down the field trying to catch the ball with her mouth.It just won't fit!</p></section>
<div><p>Once sasha saved my life When I was only 4 years old.I started to go into the street to get a ball that had rolled across the street. Of course I did not think to look for carsl sasha got infront of me and knocked me backwords onto the sidewalk.I was made until I saw the car go by where I would have been.Then i was so happy that sasha was smarter than I was!</p></div>

        <p><b>Automation and artificial intelligence are hot topics these days
            This transformation has broad impacts</b></p>
        <p>The future is fast approaching, and a new era of digital innovation and disruption is here. Or, more accurately, according to Josh Bersin, “The future of work is already here.” So yes, the robots are coming. These robots aren’t physical machines; they’re software “bots” installed on desktop computers or in the cloud that can be configured to automate increasingly complex tasks, such as moving, manipulating, and validating data.</p>

        <strong>Tesla’s Semi is off to a promising start, despite there being no official pricing information available yet</strong>
        <p>Tesla has said that its cost of operation for the Semi will help shippers save money on a per mile basis right away, and that’s likely meant to help lessen the impact of sticker shock when it finally does reveal the upfront price. But as I mentioned with the Walmart pilot, which will involve a trial of 15 Semi trucks across the U.S. and Canada, there’s additional value in helping these major shippers meet their green targets.</p>

    <p>One of those who like to contemplate about the future of technology is French designer Josselin Zaigouche who decided to design this incredible gadget, dubbed Apple Black Hole (and it's not because it will such Apple down if it hits the market). The name was probably inspired by the numerous applications one can find in Apple's device (such as iPhone and iPad).</p>
